## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft lavender (#E6E6FA), reminiscent of imagination and creativity, yet muted and comfortable.
- Background color: Light gray (#F5F5F5), very slightly violet to harmonize with the primary color, providing a clean and modern backdrop.
- Accent color: Pale violet-blue (#B0B0E0), adding a touch of ethereal beauty without overwhelming the user.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a versatile and readable humanist sans-serif, suitable for both headlines and body text in a chat application.
- Use simple, outlined icons with a touch of playfulness to represent different character attributes and actions.
- Clean and intuitive layout with clear separation of chat messages, character information, and creation tools.
- Subtle animations, such as character portraits fading in and out during conversation turns, and typing indicators, to enhance the sense of interaction.
